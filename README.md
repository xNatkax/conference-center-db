**List of functional requirements for the conference center database**
1. The Conference Center is to be able to store selected information about customers (companies, organizations) using its services. This information includes: registration data (company name, TIN ), contact information (headquarters address, telephone number, e-mail address), customer satisfaction survey results and notes from customer contacts.
2. The Conference Center's customer database system should allow authorized employees to add, update, store and search customer data according to selected criteria, such as company/organization name, TIN number and company location.
3. The Conference Center is to be able to store all necessary information about the services offered to customers. Each rented room should contain detailed information such as capacity (in persons), equipment, text description and prices of services.
4. The Conference Center's database of rooms and services should allow authorized employees to search by words or phrases contained in the text description of each item, and to filter results by categories such as room type and availability.
5. The Conference Center should be able to record all reservations in the system. Each reservation should include information such as the date and time of the reservation, details of the customer making the reservation, a list of reserved rooms and services with their schedule, and the total rental price including discount for regular customers (10-15%).
6. Any employee with appropriate rights should be able to view the history of bookings in the system. The history should be available in the form of a report with the ability to export to a CSV file, and should be searchable.
7. The client should be able to store information about completed events in the system. Each completed event should contain data on the number of participants and the number of coffee and catering portions consumed during the event. The system should allow searching completed events.

The system should allow adding new materials and editing existing ones, as well as setting low stock notifications.
9. Stock monitoring should be based on the ability to check the current quantity of each product and enter updates after an event. The system should automatically update the stock after an event, and should also be able to generate reports on material consumption.

12. Users such as salesman, procurement, contractor, social media specialist and manager should be defined in the system. Responsibilities and available functions should be defined for each role.
13. The salesperson should have access to all data except customer feedback and stock status. The procurement officer should have access to the data on stock status and catalog of goods. The contractor should only have access to orders (fulfillment and event schedule). The social media specialist should have access to customer reviews and customer data. The manager should have read-only access to all data.

**List of non-functional requirements for the conference center database**

3. Searches for customers, rooms, services and reviews should take no more than 2 seconds for standard queries and 5 seconds for more complex queries.
4. The database must have regular backups of the data at least once a day with the possibility of quick restoration in case of failure. The restoration process should be completed in no more than 1 hour from the moment the failure is reported. The system should keep backups for 30 days.
